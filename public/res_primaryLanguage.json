During my time at college I was a Research Assistant and I had the opportunity to present our research project  at a conference and later we were able to publish that project in the Journal of Psychology and Behavioral Sciences. I would like to be able to use my background in research and psychology and combine that with my new knowledge of software development and find a company that I can contribute to these skills to.",
