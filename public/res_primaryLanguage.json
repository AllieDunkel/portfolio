      "description": "My name is Allie Dunkel. I graduated from Mount Mercy University with my Bachelors of Science. My major was in Psychology and my minors were Child Studies and Criminal Justice. During my time at college I was a Research Assistant and I had the opportunity to present our research project  at a conference and later we were able to publish that project in the Journal of Psychology and Behavioral Sciences. I would like to be able to use my background in research and psychology and combine that with my new knowledge of software development and find a company that I can contribute to these skills to.",

The idea of this website came to be because there is a significant amount of people who buy books and they donâ€™t read them. By having this website people can save money, storage space, and maybe the environment by not having to buy a new copy of the book.",
